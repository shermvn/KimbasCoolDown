What I have right now:
- Working Game
    - Powerups
    - Audio
    - Menu
    - Animations 
- [Build](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DO7T7qkHKg5WwxWIU28tJY1jqHe6Wup7?usp=sharing)

Things to come:
- Change healthbar to an image so i can anchor
    - makes for better placement in builds
- figure out obstacle triggering bug
    - sometimes it does not trigger the Game Over to show but still goes to the Game Over state
- Clean Up and Consolidate
